The
pthread_mutex_destroy()
function
shall
destroy
the
mutex
object
referenced
by mutex;
the
mutex
object
becomes,
in
effect,
uninitialized.
An
implementation
may
cause
pthread_mutex_destroy()
to
set
the
object
referenced
by
mutex
to
an
invalid
value.
A
destroyed
mutex
object
can
be
reinitialized
using
pthread_mutex_init();
the
results
of
otherwise
referencing
the
object
after
it
has
been
destroyed
are
undefined
